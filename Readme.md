# Nudity Detection API

This project implements a nudity detection API using Python, Flask, and the nudenet library. The API allows you to upload an image and detect nudity in it. If nudity is detected, the API applies a blur effect to the nudity regions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Run the API

1. Start the Flask server:

   ```shell
   python api.py
   ```

2. The API is now running locally at `http://localhost:5000`.

### API Endpoint

- `POST /detect`: Upload an image file with the key `image` to detect nudity. The API will return a JSON response containing the `nudity_detected` flag and the processed image.

### Example

```shell
curl -X POST -F "image=@/path/to/image.jpg" http://localhost:5000/detect
```
